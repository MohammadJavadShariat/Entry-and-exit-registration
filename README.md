# Entry-and-exit-registration
Hello!
This program is a program for registering the entry and exit of employees.
This program first receives the names of the people who enter and records and saves the time of each entry, then after the end of entry, enter the word end.
Immediately, the program asks you for the names of the exits and the name of each person who exits must be entered, and the program itself saves the exit time, and after entering the word end, the program will enter the names of the people who entered. It also shows the check-in time as well as the names of people who checked out and their check-out time along with employees who have not checked out yet and employees who have not checked in.
Thank you for your attention!
